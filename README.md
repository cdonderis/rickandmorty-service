# Rick and Morty Api Rest
## Project Structure

To generate the project structure I have used Spring initializer from (https://start.spring.io.). I selected Maven like 
project management, Java 11 and next dependencies to start this project:

    1.Spring Data JPa.

    2.Spring Web.
    
    3.H2 Database.

In utils package locates RestTemplateConfig, to implement deserialize and mapping from response Api. Also I'd added a 
class to mapped JSON with my object "CharacterInfo".
